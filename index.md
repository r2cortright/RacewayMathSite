### A math race instead of a worksheet

Raceway Math turns everyday practice into a quick, energetic race.  
Pick your operation, choose a track, and answer as many questions as you can before time runs out. Perfect for kids building fluency or anyone who wants to sharpen basic skills in a fun way.

### What kids can practice

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Short, focused races that fit easily into a busy day  
- Timed runs that encourage both accuracy and speed

### Choose your own challenge

Every race can be tuned:

- Select which operation(s) you want to focus on  
- Adjust difficulty so newer learners and more advanced kids are both challenged  
- Change track length so a session can be very short or a bit longer, depending on how much time you have

### Built for kids and parents

- Bright, simple visuals that keep attention without being overwhelming  
- Easy, tap-friendly controls designed for young players  
- Great for practice at home, in the car, or in a classroom station

### No ads, no tracking

Raceway Math is designed with children in mind:

- No ads  
- No in-app purchases  
- No analytics or personal data collection
